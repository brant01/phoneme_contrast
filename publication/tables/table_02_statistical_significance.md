# Table 2: Statistical Significance Testing Results

| Comparison | Metric | Mean Difference | t-statistic | p-value | Adjusted p-value† | Cohen's d | Effect Size Magnitude‡ |
|------------|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Enhanced vs Baseline | RF Accuracy | +9.2% | 12.025 | <0.000002 | <0.000008 | 7.61 | Extremely Large |
| Enhanced vs Baseline | Linear Accuracy | +23.9% | 43.914 | <0.000001 | <0.000004 | 27.77 | Extremely Large |
| Enhanced vs Complex | RF Accuracy | +12.3% | 18.442 | <0.000001 | <0.000004 | 11.03 | Extremely Large |
| Enhanced vs Complex | Linear Accuracy | +36.8% | 51.223 | <0.000001 | <0.000004 | 30.65 | Extremely Large |

**Caption:** Statistical significance analysis comparing enhanced features approach against baseline and complex architecture alternatives. † Bonferroni correction applied for 4 comparisons (α = 0.0125). ‡ Effect size interpretation: Cohen's d > 0.8 = Large, d > 2.0 = Very Large, d > 5.0 = Extremely Large. All comparisons demonstrate both statistical significance and substantial practical significance with extremely large effect sizes.
