# Feature Engineering vs Architectural Complexity: A Systematic Comparison for Small-Dataset Phoneme Classification

## Abstract

**Background:** Phoneme classification in speech recognition systems requires models that can distinguish between phonetic units while remaining invariant to speaker characteristics. Traditional approaches often focus on architectural complexity, but the relative contributions of feature engineering versus model complexity remain underexplored, particularly for small datasets typical in phonetic research.

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic comparison of feature engineering versus architectural complexity for phoneme classification using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). We evaluated three approaches: (1) baseline TCN with 40 MFCC features, (2) enhanced architecture TCN with increased model complexity (4 layers, 2.86M parameters), and (3) enhanced features TCN using delta and delta-delta temporal features (60 MFCC + Δ + ΔΔ = 180 dimensions). Statistical significance was assessed using t-tests, effect size analysis (Cohen's d), and bootstrap confidence intervals across multiple random seeds.

**Results:** Enhanced features significantly outperformed both baseline and complex architecture approaches. The enhanced features TCN achieved 95.1% ± 0.4% Random Forest accuracy compared to 85.9% ± 1.3% for baseline (p < 0.000002, Cohen's d = 7.61). Notably, increased architectural complexity hurt performance (-3.0%), demonstrating overfitting on the small dataset (126 samples, 38 phonemes). Ablation studies confirmed that delta and delta-delta features drove the 9.2% improvement, not increased model capacity.

**Conclusions:** For small-scale phoneme classification tasks, systematic feature engineering provides statistically significant and practically meaningful improvements over architectural complexity. Delta and delta-delta features capture essential temporal dynamics for phoneme discrimination, while complex architectures lead to overfitting. These findings have important implications for speech recognition system design, particularly in low-resource scenarios common in phonetic research.

## Methods

## Dataset and Experimental Setup

### Dataset Description
We utilized a phoneme classification dataset consisting of 126 audio samples spanning 38 unique phonemes in Consonant-Vowel (CV) and Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) structures. The dataset was balanced across gender with 62 male and 64 female speakers, ensuring robustness to speaker variability. Phonemes included a comprehensive range of consonants in four vowel contexts (_a_, _e_, _i_, _u_), providing systematic coverage of the phonetic space.

**Dataset Size Limitations**: We acknowledge that 126 samples represents a small dataset by machine learning standards. However, this sample size is typical for controlled phonetic research where high-quality, carefully annotated speech data is required. We address this limitation through: (1) rigorous statistical validation with multiple random seeds, (2) conservative evaluation methodology using Leave-One-Out cross-validation to maximize data utilization, and (3) effect size analysis to assess practical significance beyond statistical significance.

## Overview of Experimental Results

We conducted a systematic comparison of three approaches to phoneme classification: (1) baseline TCN with standard MFCC features, (2) enhanced architecture TCN with increased model complexity, and (3) enhanced features TCN incorporating temporal delta features. All experiments were validated across multiple random seeds to ensure statistical robustness.

## Principal Findings

This study provides empirical evidence that systematic feature engineering significantly outperforms architectural complexity for phoneme classification in small-dataset scenarios. Our key finding—that temporal delta features drive a 9.2 percentage point improvement (Cohen's d = 7.61) while architectural complexity reduces performance—challenges the common assumption that model sophistication necessarily improves performance.
