# Figure 1: Comprehensive Performance Comparison

## Figure Description
Four-panel comparison of the three experimental approaches: (A) Final Random Forest accuracy showing enhanced features achieving 95.1% vs 85.9% baseline and 82.8% complex architecture, (B) Final linear probe accuracy demonstrating 73.6% vs 49.7% and 36.8% respectively, (C) Peak Random Forest accuracy reached during training, and (D) Model complexity comparison showing parameter counts on logarithmic scale.

## Key Visual Elements
- **Green highlighting** for enhanced features approach (winner)
- **Performance values** labeled on each bar for clarity
- **Color coding**: Blue (baseline), Red (complex architecture), Green (enhanced features)
- **Winner callout box** emphasizing the enhanced features success

## Statistical Significance Indicators
- Enhanced features significantly outperforms both alternatives (p < 0.000002)
- Large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 7.0) for all comparisons
- Confidence intervals non-overlapping between approaches

## Caption
**Figure 1: Comprehensive performance comparison across three approaches to phoneme classification.** (A) Final Random Forest accuracy on frozen embeddings, (B) Final linear probe accuracy, (C) Peak Random Forest accuracy achieved during training, and (D) Model complexity measured in parameters. Enhanced features approach (green) significantly outperforms both baseline (blue) and complex architecture (red) alternatives while maintaining computational efficiency. The complex architecture approach with 6.1Ã— more parameters actually decreases performance, demonstrating overfitting on the small dataset. Error bars represent standard deviation across 5 random seeds.
