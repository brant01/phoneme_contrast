# Figure 2: Statistical Significance Analysis

## Figure Description
Four-panel statistical validation of performance differences: (A) Random Forest accuracy distribution comparison via box plots, (B) Linear accuracy distribution comparison, (C) 95% confidence intervals for Random Forest accuracy with error bars, and (D) Effect sizes (Cohen's d) with magnitude interpretation guidelines.

## Key Visual Elements
- **Box plots** showing distribution characteristics (median, quartiles, outliers)
- **Confidence interval plots** with error bars representing bootstrap 95% CIs
- **Effect size visualization** with threshold lines for small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8) effects
- **Color consistency** with main comparison figure

## Statistical Highlights
- **No overlap** in confidence intervals between enhanced features and other approaches
- **Extremely large effect sizes** (d > 7.0) far exceeding conventional thresholds
- **Consistent superiority** across all statistical measures
- **Low variability** in enhanced features approach (high reproducibility)

## Caption
**Figure 2: Comprehensive statistical significance analysis.** (A,B) Box plots comparing accuracy distributions across 5 random seeds, showing median, quartiles, and range. (C) Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for Random Forest accuracy demonstrate non-overlapping intervals between approaches. (D) Effect sizes (Cohen's d) with interpretation guidelines: values >0.8 indicate large effects, >2.0 very large effects, >5.0 extremely large effects. Enhanced features approach shows extremely large effect sizes (d > 7.0) with high statistical significance (p < 0.000002) and excellent reproducibility (low variance across seeds).
