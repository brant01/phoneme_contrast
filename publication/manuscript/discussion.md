## Summary of Key Findings

This study demonstrates that supervised contrastive learning can successfully create speaker-invariant phoneme representations that capture linguistically meaningful structure. Our approach achieved 94.5% accuracy on phoneme classification while maintaining strong invariance to speaker gender, as evidenced by near-chance gender classification accuracy (52.3%) and successful cross-gender transfer (32.5%). The learned representations exhibited hierarchical organization aligned with phonetic theory, with vowel contrasts showing the strongest clustering and consonantal features showing more subtle organization.

## Theoretical Implications

### Phonetic Feature Hierarchy
Our results provide computational evidence for hierarchical organization in phonetic representation. The finding that vowel contrasts (distance ratios: 1.19-1.47) are more strongly encoded than consonantal contrasts (ratios: 0.99-1.02) aligns with linguistic theories suggesting that vowels carry more acoustic energy and are perceptually more salient. This hierarchy may reflect:

1. **Acoustic properties**: Vowels have clearer formant structures and longer durations
2. **Perceptual salience**: Vowel contrasts are typically more robust to noise
3. **Articulatory dynamics**: Vowels involve more stable vocal tract configurations

The intermediate clustering of syllable structure features (CV/VCV) suggests that the model captures suprasegmental patterns beyond individual phoneme identity.

### Speaker Normalization Mechanisms
The success of contrastive learning in achieving speaker invariance provides insights into potential neural mechanisms for speaker normalization. By explicitly optimizing for phoneme clustering while ignoring speaker identity, the model learns transformations analogous to vocal tract length normalization and formant scaling. The near-complete elimination of gender information (silhouette score: 0.0037) while preserving phonetic contrasts demonstrates that these sources of variation can be effectively disentangled through appropriate learning objectives.

### Confusion Patterns and Phonetic Similarity
The systematic confusion patterns observed (e.g., /b/→/p/ voicing, /d/→/f/ manner) mirror human perceptual confusions reported in the psycholinguistic literature. This alignment suggests that:

1. The model captures perceptually relevant acoustic features
2. Contrastive learning naturally discovers phonetic similarity structure
3. Errors reflect genuine acoustic-phonetic ambiguities rather than random misclassifications

The higher confusion rates in high vowel contexts (/i/, /u/) may reflect reduced acoustic space and increased coarticulation effects in these environments.

## Methodological Considerations

### Contrastive Learning Design Choices
Several design choices proved critical for success:

1. **Temperature parameter (τ = 0.15)**: Lower temperatures created overly tight clusters, while higher values reduced discrimination. The optimal value balances within-class cohesion and between-class separation.

2. **Multi-view augmentation**: Creating multiple views per sample was essential for learning invariant representations. The augmentation strategy must balance creating sufficient variation while preserving phonetic identity.

3. **Embedding dimension (128)**: Higher dimensions (256) led to overfitting, while lower dimensions (64) had insufficient capacity. The optimal dimension likely depends on the number of phoneme categories and acoustic complexity.

### Linear vs Non-linear Separability
The large gap between Random Forest (94.5%) and linear classifier (44.8%) performance reveals that while the embeddings contain rich discriminative information, the learned representation is inherently non-linear. This suggests:

1. Phoneme categories have complex, non-convex boundaries in acoustic space
2. Additional projection heads or fine-tuning may be needed for linear downstream tasks
3. The contrastive objective optimizes for clustering rather than linear separability

### Sample Size Limitations
With only 126 samples across 38 phonemes (average: 3.3 samples/phoneme), our results should be interpreted cautiously:
- Some phonemes had only single examples, preventing robust evaluation
- Cross-validation folds had limited diversity
- Generalization to new speakers remains untested

Despite these limitations, the consistent patterns and strong performance suggest the approach is fundamentally sound.

## Practical Applications

### Automatic Speech Recognition
The speaker-invariant representations could improve ASR systems by:
- Reducing the need for speaker adaptation
- Improving performance on underrepresented speaker groups
- Enabling better zero-shot transfer to new accents or dialects

### Clinical Applications
The explicit phonetic structure in the embeddings could benefit:
- Speech disorder diagnosis through deviation analysis
- Pronunciation assessment for language learning
- Monitoring speech development in children

### Phonetic Research
The learned representations provide tools for:
- Quantifying phonetic similarity across languages
- Studying sound change and variation
- Validating theoretical phonetic features

## Limitations and Future Directions

### Current Limitations

1. **Dataset Scale**: The small dataset limits generalizability. Larger, more diverse corpora are needed to validate findings.

2. **Speaker Diversity**: Only gender variation was examined. Real-world applications must handle age, accent, and individual differences.

3. **Phonetic Coverage**: Limited to single phonemes in simple contexts. Natural speech involves complex coarticulation and prosodic variation.

4. **Temporal Modeling**: The current approach processes fixed-length segments. Dynamic temporal modeling could better handle speech variability.

### Future Research Directions

1. **Scaling Studies**:
   - Evaluate on large-scale datasets (e.g., TIMIT, LibriSpeech)
   - Include more speaker variation dimensions
   - Test cross-linguistic generalization

2. **Architectural Improvements**:
   - Incorporate temporal modeling (RNNs, Transformers)
   - Multi-scale feature extraction
   - Learnable augmentation strategies

3. **Training Objectives**:
   - Combine contrastive loss with auxiliary tasks
   - Explore curriculum learning strategies
   - Investigate semi-supervised approaches

4. **Phonetic Analysis**:
   - Fine-grained feature analysis (e.g., formant tracking)
   - Cross-linguistic phonetic comparisons
   - Integration with articulatory data

5. **Applications**:
   - End-to-end ASR integration
   - Real-time speaker normalization
   - Pathological speech analysis

## Conclusions

This study demonstrates that supervised contrastive learning provides a principled approach to learning speaker-invariant phoneme representations. The learned embeddings exhibit linguistically meaningful structure while remaining largely invariant to speaker characteristics. These findings open new avenues for robust speech processing systems and provide computational insights into phonetic representation and speaker normalization. Future work should focus on scaling to realistic datasets and integrating these representations into practical applications.

The success of contrastive learning in this domain suggests broader applicability to other areas where invariant representations are desired, such as face recognition across lighting conditions or medical image analysis across scanning protocols. As speech technology becomes increasingly prevalent, developing representations that generalize across speaker populations while preserving linguistic content remains a critical challenge that contrastive learning helps address.
