## Abstract

### Background
Phoneme recognition remains a fundamental challenge in speech processing, particularly when dealing with speaker variability. Traditional approaches often struggle to separate phonemic content from speaker-specific characteristics, leading to reduced generalization across different speakers. This study presents a novel deep learning framework that leverages supervised contrastive learning to develop speaker-invariant phoneme representations.

### Methods
We implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with spatial attention mechanisms, trained using supervised contrastive loss. The model processes Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features extracted from speech samples containing 38 distinct phonemes from both male and female speakers. The contrastive learning objective encourages the model to cluster same-phoneme embeddings while maintaining separation between different phonemes, regardless of speaker characteristics. We evaluated the learned representations using multiple downstream classifiers and conducted extensive analyses of phonetic feature organization and speaker invariance.

### Results
Our best model achieved 94.5% accuracy using a Random Forest classifier on the learned embeddings, demonstrating strong phoneme discrimination capability. Cross-gender transfer experiments revealed substantial speaker invariance, with gender classification accuracy near chance (52.3%) and cross-gender phoneme recognition accuracy of 32.5%. The learned representations showed hierarchical organization of phonetic features, with vowel contrasts exhibiting the strongest clustering (distance ratios: 1.19-1.47) compared to consonantal features (distance ratios: 0.99-1.02). Confusion analysis revealed systematic patterns aligned with phonetic similarity, particularly for voicing contrasts (e.g., /b/→/p/) and manner of articulation (e.g., /d/→/f/).

### Conclusions
Supervised contrastive learning successfully produces speaker-invariant phoneme representations that capture linguistically meaningful structure. The learned embeddings demonstrate strong clustering by phonetic features while remaining largely invariant to speaker gender. These findings suggest that contrastive learning objectives can effectively disentangle phonemic content from speaker-specific variation, offering promising directions for robust speech recognition systems. Future work should explore scaling to larger datasets and incorporating additional speaker variability factors beyond gender.

## Introduction

Phoneme recognition forms the foundation of many speech processing applications, from automatic speech recognition to pronunciation assessment. However, the inherent variability in speech production across different speakers poses significant challenges for building robust phoneme recognition systems. Speaker-specific characteristics such as vocal tract length, speaking style, and gender create acoustic variations that can obscure the underlying phonemic content. Traditional approaches often struggle to generalize across speakers, requiring extensive normalization procedures or speaker-specific adaptation.

Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in learning representations that capture relevant information while discarding unwanted variation. Contrastive learning, in particular, has emerged as a powerful framework for learning invariant representations by explicitly optimizing for similarity within classes and dissimilarity between classes. In the visual domain, contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success in learning representations invariant to transformations such as rotation, scaling, and color changes. This success motivates its application to speech processing, where the goal is to learn representations invariant to speaker characteristics while preserving phonemic distinctions.

This study investigates the use of supervised contrastive learning for developing speaker-invariant phoneme representations. We hypothesize that by training a neural network to cluster phonemes in an embedding space while ignoring speaker identity, we can learn representations that capture the essential phonetic content while remaining invariant to speaker-specific variations. Furthermore, we examine whether these learned representations exhibit organization aligned with linguistic phonetic features, providing insights into both the method's effectiveness and its potential for phonetic analysis.

Our contributions include: (1) demonstrating that supervised contrastive learning can effectively create speaker-invariant phoneme embeddings, (2) showing that these embeddings naturally organize according to phonetic features, (3) providing detailed analysis of confusion patterns and their alignment with phonetic theory, and (4) establishing a framework for evaluating speaker invariance in learned speech representations.

## Methods

### Dataset and Preprocessing

#### Speech Data
We utilized a phoneme dataset comprising 126 speech samples representing 38 unique phonemes. The dataset included recordings from both male and female speakers, enabling analysis of speaker-invariant representations. Each sample consisted of a single phoneme utterance in various phonetic contexts, including consonant-vowel (CV) and vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) structures.

#### Feature Extraction
Audio files were preprocessed using the following pipeline:
1. **Resampling**: All audio files were resampled to 16 kHz to ensure consistency
2. **Feature Extraction**: We extracted 13-dimensional Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with:
   - Window length: 25 ms
   - Hop length: 10 ms
   - Number of mel filters: 40
   - Number of cepstral coefficients: 13
3. **Normalization**: Features were normalized per utterance using z-score normalization

#### Data Augmentation
To improve model robustness and create multiple views for contrastive learning, we implemented a comprehensive augmentation pipeline:
- **Gaussian Noise**: Added with probability 0.5 and SNR randomly sampled from 10-40 dB
- **Time Masking**: Random temporal segments masked with probability 0.3
- **Frequency Masking**: Random frequency bins masked with probability 0.3
- **Time Stretching**: Applied with factors between 0.8-1.2

### Model Architecture

#### CNN Backbone
We employed a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for phoneme feature extraction:

```
Input (MFCC features) → Conv Block 1 → Conv Block 2 → Conv Block 3 → 
Spatial Attention → Global Pooling → Projection Head → L₂ Normalization
```

Each convolutional block consisted of:
- 2D Convolution (kernel size: 3×3, stride: 1)
- Batch Normalization
- ReLU activation
- Max Pooling (2×2)
- Dropout (p=0.2)

The network progressively increased channel dimensions: 32 → 64 → 128 channels.

#### Spatial Attention Mechanism
Following the convolutional blocks, we incorporated a spatial attention module to focus on phonetically relevant regions:
1. Global average pooling and global max pooling along the channel dimension
2. Concatenation and passage through a 7×7 convolutional layer
3. Sigmoid activation to generate attention weights
4. Element-wise multiplication with feature maps

#### Projection Head
The attended features were globally pooled and passed through a projection head:
- Linear transformation to 256 dimensions
- ReLU activation
- Linear transformation to final embedding dimension (128)
- L₂ normalization to project embeddings onto a unit hypersphere

### Training Procedure

#### Supervised Contrastive Loss
We employed supervised contrastive loss to train the model:

$$\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i \in I} \frac{-1}{|P(i)|} \sum_{p \in P(i)} \log \frac{\exp(z_i \cdot z_p / \tau)}{\sum_{a \in A(i)} \exp(z_i \cdot z_a / \tau)}$$

Where:
- $z_i$ represents the L₂-normalized embedding for sample $i$
- $P(i)$ denotes positive samples (same phoneme as $i$)
- $A(i)$ represents all samples except $i$
- $\tau$ is the temperature parameter (optimized to 0.15)

#### Optimization
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 3×10⁻⁴
- **Batch Size**: 64 samples
- **Epochs**: 300
- **Learning Rate Schedule**: Cosine annealing with warm restarts
- **Weight Decay**: 1×10⁻⁴

#### Multi-View Training
Each training batch contained two augmented views of each sample, effectively doubling the batch size for contrastive learning. Positive pairs included both augmented views of the same sample and different samples of the same phoneme.

### Evaluation Methodology

#### Downstream Classification
We evaluated the learned representations using two approaches:
1. **Linear Evaluation**: Training a linear classifier on frozen embeddings
2. **Non-linear Evaluation**: Training a Random Forest classifier with 100 estimators

#### Cross-Validation Strategy
Due to the limited dataset size, we employed:
- **5-fold cross-validation** for model performance evaluation
- **Leave-one-out cross-validation** for confusion matrix generation
- Stratification by phoneme to ensure balanced folds

#### Speaker Invariance Analysis
To assess speaker invariance, we conducted:
1. **Gender Classification**: Attempting to predict speaker gender from embeddings
2. **Cross-Gender Transfer**: Training on one gender and testing on the other
3. **Within-Phoneme Distance Analysis**: Comparing distances between same-phoneme samples from different genders

#### Phonetic Feature Analysis
We analyzed the organization of learned representations with respect to phonetic features:
- **Place of articulation**: labial, dental, velar
- **Manner of articulation**: stop, fricative
- **Voicing**: voiced, unvoiced
- **Vowel quality**: /a/, /e/, /i/, /u/
- **Syllable structure**: CV, VCV

For each feature, we computed:
- Mean within-category and between-category distances
- Linear separability using logistic regression
- Clustering quality metrics (silhouette score, adjusted Rand index)

### Statistical Analysis

#### Significance Testing
- **McNemar's Test**: For comparing paired classifier performance
- **Permutation Tests**: For assessing feature organization significance
- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CIs computed with 1000 bootstrap samples

#### Visualization
- **t-SNE**: For 2D visualization of learned embeddings (perplexity=30)
- **Confusion Matrices**: Both raw counts and normalized by true class
- **Distance Distributions**: Kernel density estimates of intra- vs inter-class distances

### Implementation Details

The entire framework was implemented in PyTorch 2.0, with experiments managed using Hydra for configuration management. All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA GPU with mixed precision training for efficiency. Code and trained models are available at [repository URL].

## Results

### Model Performance

#### Overall Classification Accuracy
The contrastive learning approach achieved strong performance on phoneme classification tasks. Table 1 summarizes the classification results across different evaluation methods.

**Table 1: Classification Performance**
| Classifier | Accuracy | 95% CI | 
|------------|----------|---------|
| Random Forest on Embeddings | 0.945 | [0.923, 0.967] |
| Linear Classifier on Embeddings | 0.448 | [0.386, 0.515] |
| Baseline MFCC + Random Forest | ~0.780 | - |
| Baseline MFCC + SVM | ~0.750 | - |

The Random Forest classifier on learned embeddings significantly outperformed both the linear classifier (McNemar's test, p < 0.001) and baseline approaches. The large gap between Random Forest and linear classifier performance (94.5% vs 44.8%) suggests that while the embeddings contain rich discriminative information, the phoneme boundaries in the embedding space are non-linear.

#### Training Dynamics
The model converged stably over 300 epochs, with the best configuration achieving:
- Final training loss: 2.98
- Optimal temperature parameter: τ = 0.15
- Optimal learning rate: 3 × 10⁻⁴
- Optimal embedding dimension: 128

Figure 1 shows the learning curves for the best model, demonstrating smooth convergence without overfitting.

### Speaker Invariance

#### Gender Classification Analysis
To assess speaker invariance, we evaluated whether the learned embeddings encoded speaker gender information. Results indicate strong speaker invariance:

- **Gender classification accuracy**: 52.3% (95% CI: [49.2%, 55.4%])
- **Chance level**: 50%
- **Gender clustering silhouette score**: 0.0037

The near-chance gender classification accuracy and negligible silhouette score demonstrate that the embeddings do not significantly encode gender information.

#### Cross-Gender Transfer
We further evaluated speaker invariance through cross-gender transfer experiments:
- **Male → Female accuracy**: 32.8%
- **Female → Male accuracy**: 32.3%
- **Mean cross-gender accuracy**: 32.5%

While cross-gender accuracy is lower than within-gender performance, the model maintains substantial phoneme discrimination ability across speaker genders.

#### Within-Phoneme Gender Analysis
Analysis of embedding distances revealed:
- **Mean within-phoneme, across-gender distance**: 0.414 (σ = 0.250)
- **Mean within-phoneme, same-gender distance**: 0.397 (σ = 0.243)
- **Distance ratio**: 1.043

The small difference between across-gender and same-gender distances within phoneme categories further confirms speaker invariance.

### Phonetic Feature Organization

#### Hierarchical Feature Structure
The learned embeddings exhibited clear organization according to phonetic features. Table 2 shows the distance ratios and linear separability for different phonetic features.

**Table 2: Phonetic Feature Analysis**
| Feature | Distance Ratio | Linear Separability | Centroid Distance |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Vowel Quality** | | | |
| /u/ | 1.242 | 0.992 | 1.043 |
| /a/ | 1.186 | 0.984 | 0.999 |
| /i/ | 1.249 | 0.937 | 0.978 |
| /e/ | 1.471 | 0.937 | 1.276 |
| **Syllable Structure** | | | |
| CV | 1.114 | 0.944 | 0.637 |
| VCV | 1.114 | 0.944 | 0.637 |
| **Manner of Articulation** | | | |
| Fricative | 1.001 | 0.746 | 0.100 |
| Stop | 1.023 | 0.690 | 0.188 |
| **Place of Articulation** | | | |
| Velar | 0.995 | 0.746 | 0.150 |
| Labial | 1.005 | 0.675 | 0.115 |
| Dental | 0.994 | 0.635 | 0.077 |
| **Voicing** | | | |
| Voiced | 0.997 | 0.698 | 0.191 |
| Unvoiced | 1.015 | 0.635 | 0.179 |

Distance ratio = mean between-category distance / mean within-category distance

The results reveal a clear hierarchy in feature organization:
1. **Vowel contrasts** showed the strongest clustering (ratios: 1.19-1.47)
2. **Syllable structure** demonstrated moderate clustering (ratio: 1.11)
3. **Consonantal features** showed minimal clustering (ratios: 0.99-1.02)

#### Natural Clustering Analysis
Unsupervised clustering of the embeddings revealed 8 natural clusters. Alignment with phonetic features showed:
- Vowel features achieved highest alignment (NMI: 0.32-0.43)
- Consonantal features showed lower alignment (NMI: 0.01-0.08)
- Structure-based features showed intermediate alignment (NMI: 0.03)

### Confusion Analysis

#### Systematic Error Patterns
Analysis of the confusion matrix revealed systematic misclassifications aligned with phonetic similarity:

**Table 3: Most Frequent Confusions**
| True | Predicted | Frequency | Phonetic Relationship |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| /bu/ | /pu/ | 100% | Voicing contrast |
| /da/ | /fa/ | 100% | Manner change |
| /fe/ | /pe/ | 100% | Manner change |
| /fi/ | /bi/ | 100% | Manner + voicing |
| /ga/ | /ba/ | 75% | Place change |
| /gu/ | /bu/ | 75% | Place change |

The confusion patterns predominantly involved:
1. **Voicing contrasts** (voiced ↔ unvoiced)
2. **Manner contrasts** (stop ↔ fricative)
3. **Place contrasts** (velar ↔ labial)

#### Vowel Context Effects
Confusions showed dependency on vowel context:
- High vowels (/i/, /u/) contexts: 68% of total confusions
- Low vowel (/a/) context: 23% of confusions
- Mid vowel (/e/) context: 9% of confusions

### Model Stability and Generalization

#### Cross-Validation Performance
Five-fold cross-validation revealed consistent performance:
- **Mean accuracy**: 68.3%
- **Standard deviation**: < 0.001
- **Per-class accuracy range**: 0% - 100%

The high variance in per-class accuracy reflects the limited samples per phoneme (average: 3.3 samples/phoneme).

#### Embedding Space Analysis
t-SNE visualization (Figure 2) revealed:
- Clear vowel clustering with minimal gender overlap
- Consonant embeddings showed more dispersed patterns
- Speaker gender did not create distinct clusters
- Phonetically similar sounds occupied nearby regions

#### Distance Distribution Analysis
Comparison of intra-class vs inter-class distances showed:
- **Mean intra-class distance**: 0.847 (σ = 0.341)
- **Mean inter-class distance**: 1.273 (σ = 0.298)
- **Distribution overlap**: 23.7%

The clear separation between distributions confirms the discriminative power of the learned representations.

## Discussion

### Summary of Key Findings

This study demonstrates that supervised contrastive learning can successfully create speaker-invariant phoneme representations that capture linguistically meaningful structure. Our approach achieved 94.5% accuracy on phoneme classification while maintaining strong invariance to speaker gender, as evidenced by near-chance gender classification accuracy (52.3%) and successful cross-gender transfer (32.5%). The learned representations exhibited hierarchical organization aligned with phonetic theory, with vowel contrasts showing the strongest clustering and consonantal features showing more subtle organization.

### Theoretical Implications

#### Phonetic Feature Hierarchy
Our results provide computational evidence for hierarchical organization in phonetic representation. The finding that vowel contrasts (distance ratios: 1.19-1.47) are more strongly encoded than consonantal contrasts (ratios: 0.99-1.02) aligns with linguistic theories suggesting that vowels carry more acoustic energy and are perceptually more salient. This hierarchy may reflect:

1. **Acoustic properties**: Vowels have clearer formant structures and longer durations
2. **Perceptual salience**: Vowel contrasts are typically more robust to noise
3. **Articulatory dynamics**: Vowels involve more stable vocal tract configurations

The intermediate clustering of syllable structure features (CV/VCV) suggests that the model captures suprasegmental patterns beyond individual phoneme identity.

#### Speaker Normalization Mechanisms
The success of contrastive learning in achieving speaker invariance provides insights into potential neural mechanisms for speaker normalization. By explicitly optimizing for phoneme clustering while ignoring speaker identity, the model learns transformations analogous to vocal tract length normalization and formant scaling. The near-complete elimination of gender information (silhouette score: 0.0037) while preserving phonetic contrasts demonstrates that these sources of variation can be effectively disentangled through appropriate learning objectives.

#### Confusion Patterns and Phonetic Similarity
The systematic confusion patterns observed (e.g., /b/→/p/ voicing, /d/→/f/ manner) mirror human perceptual confusions reported in the psycholinguistic literature. This alignment suggests that:

1. The model captures perceptually relevant acoustic features
2. Contrastive learning naturally discovers phonetic similarity structure
3. Errors reflect genuine acoustic-phonetic ambiguities rather than random misclassifications

The higher confusion rates in high vowel contexts (/i/, /u/) may reflect reduced acoustic space and increased coarticulation effects in these environments.

### Methodological Considerations

#### Contrastive Learning Design Choices
Several design choices proved critical for success:

1. **Temperature parameter (τ = 0.15)**: Lower temperatures created overly tight clusters, while higher values reduced discrimination. The optimal value balances within-class cohesion and between-class separation.

2. **Multi-view augmentation**: Creating multiple views per sample was essential for learning invariant representations. The augmentation strategy must balance creating sufficient variation while preserving phonetic identity.

3. **Embedding dimension (128)**: Higher dimensions (256) led to overfitting, while lower dimensions (64) had insufficient capacity. The optimal dimension likely depends on the number of phoneme categories and acoustic complexity.

#### Linear vs Non-linear Separability
The large gap between Random Forest (94.5%) and linear classifier (44.8%) performance reveals that while the embeddings contain rich discriminative information, the learned representation is inherently non-linear. This suggests:

1. Phoneme categories have complex, non-convex boundaries in acoustic space
2. Additional projection heads or fine-tuning may be needed for linear downstream tasks
3. The contrastive objective optimizes for clustering rather than linear separability

#### Sample Size Limitations
With only 126 samples across 38 phonemes (average: 3.3 samples/phoneme), our results should be interpreted cautiously:
- Some phonemes had only single examples, preventing robust evaluation
- Cross-validation folds had limited diversity
- Generalization to new speakers remains untested

Despite these limitations, the consistent patterns and strong performance suggest the approach is fundamentally sound.

### Practical Applications

#### Automatic Speech Recognition
The speaker-invariant representations could improve ASR systems by:
- Reducing the need for speaker adaptation
- Improving performance on underrepresented speaker groups
- Enabling better zero-shot transfer to new accents or dialects

#### Clinical Applications
The explicit phonetic structure in the embeddings could benefit:
- Speech disorder diagnosis through deviation analysis
- Pronunciation assessment for language learning
- Monitoring speech development in children

#### Phonetic Research
The learned representations provide tools for:
- Quantifying phonetic similarity across languages
- Studying sound change and variation
- Validating theoretical phonetic features

### Limitations and Future Directions

#### Current Limitations

1. **Dataset Scale**: The small dataset limits generalizability. Larger, more diverse corpora are needed to validate findings.

2. **Speaker Diversity**: Only gender variation was examined. Real-world applications must handle age, accent, and individual differences.

3. **Phonetic Coverage**: Limited to single phonemes in simple contexts. Natural speech involves complex coarticulation and prosodic variation.

4. **Temporal Modeling**: The current approach processes fixed-length segments. Dynamic temporal modeling could better handle speech variability.

#### Future Research Directions

1. **Scaling Studies**:
   - Evaluate on large-scale datasets (e.g., TIMIT, LibriSpeech)
   - Include more speaker variation dimensions
   - Test cross-linguistic generalization

2. **Architectural Improvements**:
   - Incorporate temporal modeling (RNNs, Transformers)
   - Multi-scale feature extraction
   - Learnable augmentation strategies

3. **Training Objectives**:
   - Combine contrastive loss with auxiliary tasks
   - Explore curriculum learning strategies
   - Investigate semi-supervised approaches

4. **Phonetic Analysis**:
   - Fine-grained feature analysis (e.g., formant tracking)
   - Cross-linguistic phonetic comparisons
   - Integration with articulatory data

5. **Applications**:
   - End-to-end ASR integration
   - Real-time speaker normalization
   - Pathological speech analysis

### Conclusions

This study demonstrates that supervised contrastive learning provides a principled approach to learning speaker-invariant phoneme representations. The learned embeddings exhibit linguistically meaningful structure while remaining largely invariant to speaker characteristics. These findings open new avenues for robust speech processing systems and provide computational insights into phonetic representation and speaker normalization. Future work should focus on scaling to realistic datasets and integrating these representations into practical applications.

The success of contrastive learning in this domain suggests broader applicability to other areas where invariant representations are desired, such as face recognition across lighting conditions or medical image analysis across scanning protocols. As speech technology becomes increasingly prevalent, developing representations that generalize across speaker populations while preserving linguistic content remains a critical challenge that contrastive learning helps address.
