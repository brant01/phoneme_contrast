# Reviewer Response Preparation
reviewer_responses:
  
  dataset_size_limitation:
    response: |
      "We acknowledge the dataset size limitation (126 samples, 38 phonemes) and position 
      this work as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal feature 
      engineering for phoneme classification. The systematic improvements across multiple 
      architectures and the large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) suggest genuine advances 
      despite the limited scale."
      
  methodology_rigor:
    response: |
      "We have standardized our evaluation methodology using stratified k-fold cross-validation 
      where possible, with Leave-One-Out CV only for cases where class sizes prevent stratification. 
      All improvements are validated with formal statistical significance testing and effect size analysis."
      
  generalizability_concerns:
    response: |
      "While our primary evaluation is on a single dataset, the core finding - that temporal 
      features (delta/delta-delta) significantly improve phoneme representation learning - 
      aligns with decades of speech recognition research and established acoustic-phonetic theory."
